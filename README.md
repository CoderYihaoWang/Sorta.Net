# Sorta.Net

Sorta.Net is the C# backend implementation of Sorta. The aim of the Sorta project is to build a web app that can visualize comparison-based sorting algorithms.

The Sorta project has a standalone frontend (WIP), so that the backend can be implemented using various programming languages, as long as they provides the same API. 

This repository is the C# implementation of the Sorta API. You can fork this repo and add your own sorting algorithms. Once connected with the frontend, you will be able to see your own sorting algorithms in animation.
